# Cycle Detection MCP Server

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for detecting cycles in reasoning (circular reasoning or feedback loops).

## Features

- Detect cycles in a reasoning graph
- Identify self-reinforcing or circular logic
- Useful for both flaw detection and systems thinking (feedback loops)

## Tool

### cycle_detection

Facilitates detection of cycles in a directed graph of reasoning steps.

**Inputs:**
- `nodes` (array of strings): Reasoning steps or concepts
- `edges` (array of [from, to] pairs): Directed relationships

## Usage

The Cycle Detection tool is designed for:
- Identifying circular reasoning
- Finding feedback loops in systems
- Diagnosing reasoning flaws

## Configuration

(Configure as with other MCP servers, see sequentialthinking for details.)
