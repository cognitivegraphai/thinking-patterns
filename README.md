# Thinking Patterns

This repository is a collection of [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) **Thinking Patterns**.

- **[Bayesian Networks](bayesian)** - Probabilistic reasoning with conditional dependencies, belief updates, and evidence propagation 
- **[Bipartite Graphs](bipartite)** - Pro-con analysis and decision support using two disjoint node sets and weighted factors 
- **[Cycle Detection](cycle)** - Detects cycles and feedback loops in reasoning, useful for identifying circular logic or system feedback 
- **[DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)](dag)** - Causal reasoning with multi-cause/multi-effect relationships, supporting forward and backward traversal 
- **[Semantic Networks](semantic)** - Associative reasoning with concept nodes and relationship edges, supporting spreading activation and semantic queries 
- **[Sequential Thinking](sequentialthinking)** - Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thought sequences
- **[Small-World Networks](smallworld)** - Heuristic shortcuts and analogy-based reasoning, modeling clusters and long-range connections 
- **[Tree Structures](tree)** - Deductive and inductive hierarchies, supporting top-down and bottom-up reasoning
