# Bayesian Network Reasoning MCP Server

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for probabilistic reasoning using Bayesian networks.

## Features

- Represent variables and their conditional dependencies as a Bayesian network
- Update beliefs based on evidence
- Model uncertainty and probabilistic inference

## Tool

### bayesian_network_reasoning

Facilitates probabilistic reasoning using Bayesian network structures.

**Inputs:**
- `nodes` (array of strings): Variables
- `edges` (array of [from, to] pairs): Conditional dependencies
- `evidence` (object, optional): Observed values for variables

## Usage

The Bayesian Network Reasoning tool is designed for:
- Updating beliefs based on new evidence
- Modeling uncertainty in complex systems
- Probabilistic inference

## Configuration

(Configure as with other MCP servers, see sequentialthinking for details.)
