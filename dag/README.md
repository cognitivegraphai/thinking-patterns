# DAG Reasoning MCP Server

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for causal reasoning using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

## Features

- Represent events and their cause-effect relationships as a DAG
- Support multiple causes for a single effect
- Traverse forward (predicting effects) or backward (diagnosing causes)

## Tool

### dag_reasoning

Facilitates causal reasoning using DAG structures.

**Inputs:**
- `nodes` (array of strings): Events or variables
- `edges` (array of [from, to] pairs): Cause-effect relationships
- `traversal` (string, optional): 'forward' or 'backward'

## Usage

The DAG Reasoning tool is designed for:
- Predicting effects from causes
- Diagnosing causes from effects
- Modeling complex causal systems

## Configuration

(Configure as with other MCP servers, see sequentialthinking for details.)
