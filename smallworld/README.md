# Small-World Network Reasoning MCP Server

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for heuristic shortcut reasoning using small-world networks.

## Features

- Represent clusters and long-range connections in a small-world network
- Model reasoning by analogy or heuristic jumps
- Analyze efficiency and error-proneness of shortcut reasoning

## Tool

### smallworld_network_reasoning

Facilitates heuristic shortcut reasoning using small-world network structures.

**Inputs:**
- `nodes` (array of strings): Concepts or states
- `edges` (array of [from, to] pairs): Connections (short or long-range)
- `startNode` (string, optional): Node to begin traversal
- `endNode` (string, optional): Target node for shortcut

## Usage

The Small-World Network Reasoning tool is designed for:
- Modeling analogical or shortcut reasoning
- Analyzing clusters and jumps in reasoning
- Exploring efficiency vs. error in heuristic thinking

## Configuration

(Configure as with other MCP servers, see sequentialthinking for details.)
