# Semantic Network Reasoning MCP Server

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for associative reasoning using semantic networks.

## Features

- Represent concepts and their relationships as a semantic network
- Support various relationship types (e.g., is-a, part-of, has)
- Traverse via spreading activation (priming one concept activates related ones)

## Tool

### semantic_network_reasoning

Facilitates associative reasoning using semantic network structures.

**Inputs:**
- `nodes` (array of strings): Concepts
- `edges` (array of [from, relation, to] triples): Relationships between concepts
- `startNode` (string, optional): Node to activate for spreading

## Usage

The Semantic Network Reasoning tool is designed for:
- Exploring associations between concepts
- Priming related ideas
- Modeling knowledge as a network

## Configuration

(Configure as with other MCP servers, see sequentialthinking for details.)
